RL.STD.ERR,Rule of Law: Standard Error,"Rule of Law captures perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence. Standard error indicates the precision of the estimate of governance.  Larger values of the standard error indicate less precise estimates.  A 90 percent confidence interval for the governance estimate is given by the estimate +/- 1.64 times the standard error.","Detailed documentation of the WGI, interactive tools for exploring the data, and full access to the underlying source data available at www.govindicators.org.The WGI are produced by Daniel Kaufmann (Natural Resource Governance Institute and Brookings Institution) and Aart Kraay (World Bank Development Research Group).
